# Mechanics Management Page Updates

## Overview
Updated the Mechanics Management Page in the Shop Owner interface to reflect inviting existing mechanics instead of creating new accounts. The system now properly handles invitations to existing mechanics who are independent and not currently part of another shop.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Mock Data Structure** (`data/shopOwnerMockData.ts`)
- **Added `shopMechanics`**: List of mechanics currently in the shop (including invited ones)
- **Added `availableMechanics`**: List of independent mechanics available for invitation
- **Added `isAvailable` flag**: Tracks whether a mechanic can be invited or is already in another shop
- **Updated status system**: Now includes "Active" and "Invited" statuses

### 2. **Redesigned Invite Modal**
- **Replaced "Add Mechanic" with "Invite Mechanic"**: No longer creates new accounts
- **Searchable mechanic list**: Filter by name or expertise
- **Visual availability indicators**: Shows which mechanics are available vs. already in other shops
- **Proper error handling**: Shows toast notification when trying to invite unavailable mechanics

### 3. **Enhanced Confirmation System**
- **Invite confirmation modal**: Shows before sending invitation
- **Clear messaging**: Explains what happens when inviting a mechanic
- **Toast notifications**: Success messages and error alerts

### 4. **Updated Mechanics Table**
- **New status display**: Shows "Active" vs "Invited" with appropriate badges
- **Status-specific information**: Different data shown based on mechanic status
- **Invited status messaging**: "Waiting for mechanic confirmation" for pending invites
- **Enhanced remove functionality**: Different messaging for removing vs canceling invitations

### 5. **Improved Statistics Overview**
- **Added "Invited" count**: New KPI card showing pending invitations
- **Status-aware calculations**: Only active mechanics count toward earnings/bookings
- **6-column grid layout**: Accommodates the new invited status

### 6. **Updated Filter System**
- **Replaced "Inactive" with "Invited"**: More relevant status filtering
- **Status-aware filtering**: Filter by All, Active, or Invited mechanics
